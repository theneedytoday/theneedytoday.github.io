## History/background Information

The Needy Today is a fully registered Local Non-governmental organization that has its head office in Magbenteh Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone and its sub-office at 53 Bai Bureh Road Freetown.
The organization started in 2005 by Mr. Dauda Ahmid Koroma who is the founder and Executive Director and some other young Sierra Leoneans with the motive of initially providing support to children that were greatly devastated by the eleven year civil war. Our Support to these children ranged from quality education, provision of quality care support including food, health care facility and foster care adoption.

From inception, we have so far supported 1,815 children in 98 communities within Bombali, Port Loko and Koinadugu districts.

Since then our mandate has opened considerably as we also now address issues relating youth and women empowerment, support to disabled persons and support to Ebola persons off late. More specifically, our assistance to these needy categories of people ranges from __Education/skills training, agriculture, microfinance/grants, entrepreneurship training, food, quality health care and sanitation and clothes/wears.__

So far we have been able to meaningfully support 962 youths, 413 deprived women and 550 disabled persons. Through our initiatives, we have helped changed the miserable lives of these people and are coping glaringly well with their families.

We would have gone beyond our present operational areas but limited resources have curtailed us so far. Actually there are many more in need of support and we hope to reach them once we access the available funds/materials.
