          <p>The operations of TNT is undertaken by 4 different categories of people within each with specific roles to perform at different levels.</p>
          <p><strong>
            Permanent Staff   
          </strong></p>
          <p>Presently this organization employs the service of 22 staff as shown below:</p>
          <h1>Casual Staff</h1>
          <p>The organization recruits CASUAL WORKERS as required by certain projects more especially with extensive projects. With bigger projects we normally hire the service of casual workers to undertake field data collection processes.
          </p>
          <h1>Volunteers</h1>
          <p>The Needy Today is opened to people who want to volunteer working with us. We have enjoyed working with few from within and out of Sierra Leone who have endeavored at their best in devising and executing strategies already aimed by the organization. To local volunteers we provide allowances for them at times but for international volunteers, we encourage them to address their sustenance commitments whiles working with us.</p>
          <h1>Care Givers/Foster Parents</h1>
          <p>Because we support some children whiles in foster cares, not really a pay but we normally provide allowances to experienced care givers who take care of the absolutely deprived children we have withdrawn to foster care solutions. Presently we have 15 of them and are doing great job. They are all knowledgeable mothers who recommend advices as to the wellbeing of these children.</p>
