      <p>The eleven years rebel conflict coursed the death of many people. The worst victims are the children in Mathinka Village, Makeni â€“ Northern Sierra Leone. Most children lost their parent and are now orphan whiles some are abandoned in the street and at high social risks. These orphans have no one to care for them. As a result the target beneficiaries of this programme is the orphans and street children in the Mathinka Village, Makeni Northern Sierra Leone.</p>

      <p>At present only 3 orphans are residing in the orphanage. There are 125 street children who are not residing in the orphanage due to lack of space but they benefit from our services. These children have been place under foster care.</p>
      <br>
      <p>For the care of the orphans we need adequate food, clothing, Medicare support and educational support. We are really constrained by lack of funds to support these orphans and street children. There are many others that we want to support but we want to take care of those in the orphanage and those in the foster homes first.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>For residential:</strong><br> we need support in the areas of food, clothing, Medicare and educational support. For non residential-we need support in the areas of clothing, Medicare and educational support. All these detail you will find in the <a href="donate.html">budget</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Target beneficiaries:</strong><br> Underprivileged and impoverished and disabled Children, youths and women in life difficult circumstances. Orphans, destitute, abandoned and disabled children are given priority.</p>
