        <h1>How does The Needy Today sponsorship program affect the life of needy child?</h1>
      </header>

      <body>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Sponsorship allows and orphan to attend school, and stay in school for as long as he or she is able. Without helping, many children of the poor are force to drop out of school prematuredly.Every child receive Christian training through Sunday School and church Bible class. Children have the opportunity to learn about Jesus and to grow and develop in their faith.Sponsorship also removes barriers to a child’s development. By providing a host of learning opportunity, while also easing a child current poverty, lasting change can occur in a needy child’s life.</p>

        <h1>How does sponsorship affect others in the child’s family and community?</h1>
      </header>

      <body>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Because the emphasis of TNT is learning and development, the benefit of sponsorship spread beyond the orphan to others. For example, it is very common to become the family “Teacher” child-helping mum, dad and siblings learn how to read and write.Also, as sponsored children learn skills, get an education and grow older, they become a source of leadership and help to the whole community.</p>

        <h1>How long should a sponsorship last?</h1>
      </header>

      <body>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Children typically enter The Needy Today at the age of 2 month to ten years. They continue for as long as they want to proceed in School. Some sponsor support a child their entire time. Perhaps ten years or more. Other support a child for one or two years. Either approach is valuable and helpful. A sponsor may discontinue at any time.</p>

      <body>
        <div class="text">
          <p>The child is registered to a new sponsor as soon as possible. In most cases this is now interruption of support.</p>

        <h1>What does TNT sponsorship program offer to sponsors?</h1>
      </header>

      <body>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Sponsorship gives people the opportunity to learn about orphan in poverty and to be involved in the process of sharing over a span.Many of our sponsors say, “Because we give regularly to a orphan in need, because we pray and communicate with our child, our own children are learning what it means to put the faith into practice”Sponsoring a child also allow for two-way communicating and caring. Letters and photos are exchanged, which over time can create a bonding of love and appreciation. Many sponsors have expressed great joy that they are prayed for by these children they support. Often a deep spirituality is found in midst of poverty.</p>

      <body>
        <div class="text">
          <p>You may write as often as you wish. Some sponsors write once or twice a year, while others write every month. Sponsored children write to their sponsors about three times a year.</p>

        <h1>Can I visit my sponsored child?</h1>
      </header>

      <body>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Yes, and we encourage sponsors to consider this potentially life changing experience.</p>

        <h1>Does my child receive my support in cash?</h1>
      </header>

      <body>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Not in most cases. We have learnt that giving cash directly to children is not the best way to help. Your support is used to provide services, benefits and opportunities for your child such as education, health care and school supplies. By carefully managing the support for all sponsored children in a project, we can ensure the best possible impact for each child.</p>

      <body>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Yes, many people ask to sponsor a boy or a girl of the same age as their own child or grand child. Others have a strong interest in a particular region in Sierra Leone. Simply tell us your preference, and we will do our best to match it with a child from our list of children who currently need a sponsor.</p>
