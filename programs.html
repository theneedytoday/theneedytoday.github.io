          <p>TNT has a home which is rented as an orphanage.</p>
          <p>A home mother managed the home with four mummies. All of these five personnel are female and widows as well.</p>
          <p>They have been well experience caregivers in taking care of their families and other children.</p>
          <br>
          <h1 id="project-regular-title">Child sponsorship</h1>
          <p id="project-content">There are many children in Sierra Leone who, through many factors, have been orphaned, abandoned, or separated from their families. The past protracted civil war further disfranchised many people and robbed children of their homes and family resources. Many children lack proper food, clothing, shelter and fees for education. For these children, financial assistance may be beneficial in order to ensure that the child can be educated and grow to become a responsible and self-sufficient adult.</p>
          <p id="project-content">The primary goal of the Child Sponsorship Programme is to help provide economic assistance to children who have been orphaned, abandoned or separated from their families and are at high social risks due to extreme hardship, war, and poverty. The purpose of the assistance is to prevent the child from further abandonment and suffering or living on the streets for basic survival. The monthly assistance provided would be in the form of food staples, clothing, medical care and educational expenses for children identified as being at risk. An effort would be made to identify street children with families living in the locality that can be reunited with their families through assistance.</p>
          <p id="project-content">The Needy Today long-term goal is to provide education and opportunities to help these identified children eventually establish their own means of self- support in adulthood. This will help to foster positive self-esteem for the children by encouraging self-sufficiency. The Child Sponsorship Programme will be designed to provide foster families, educational fees, and provide monthly assistance for poverty stricken children in the programme, as it is the desire of The Needy Today Sierra Leone to provide avenues for long-term self-support.</p>

      <div>
        <h1 id="project-regular-title">Programme for Foster Care and Adoption</h1>
        <div class="text">
          <p id="project-content">Sierra Leone is faced with many critical situations regardin   the well being of children, especially war orphans. The Needy Today Sierra Leone believes that the overriding principle in child welfare policy is the best interest of the child. The guiding conviction is the importance of a family in a child’s life. The love, care and affection that a child receives in their own family, are more intense than elsewhere. Orphans, while deprived of their biological family, nevertheless are in need of a permanent family in which to grow. If an extended family system is not available to them, the next priority becomes care by non-relatives in the form of foster care and adoption. In this case, intercountry adoption is one avenue that can afford an orphan child permanent family structure that is vitally needed for a child’s health and well being. It is the belief of The Needy Today that institutional care should only be used as a last resort for orphaned children.</p>
          <p id="project-content">The goal of The Needy Today Sierra Leone is to work with the Sierra Leonean government, Legal offices, Embassies, NGOs, INGOs, Missions and agencies for the welfare of orphaned infants or children who are in immediate need of intensive living care, and who need a long-term plan involving permanent placement in a family for their best future. The Needy Today Sierra Leone considers long-term institutional care a last resort and prefers to assist these infants/children through temporary, transitional care while at the same time developing a plan for a permanent, loving family environment in which the children will grow and flourish or place them in orphanages. Infants or children accepted into care are being placed in temporary foster homes and given the financial support necessary to provide all the milk, food, clothing, shelter, medical care, love and nurture necessary to ensure their survival and growth.. Efforts will be focused on promoting national and international adoption for those children who will best be helped through adoption.</p>

        <h1 id="project-regular-title">Water and Sanitation</h1>
        <div class="text">
          <p id="project-content">Sierra Leone faced serious humanitarian crisis during the ten years of civil war, where lives, personal properties and social infrastructures like health facilities, schools and water and sanitation facilities were discriminately destroyed. Water and sanitation facilities in the villages are damnly poor and are grossly inadequate for the settled populations after this war. The estimation of Sierra Leone population access to safe water is less than 34% and to sanitation less than 12%. Sierra Leone is still beset by infectious diseases including tetanus, typhoid and diarrhoea that lead to child deaths. This inadequate access has posed diseases among vulnerable groups like children and women with outbreaks of diarrhoea disease and cholera.</p>
          <p id="project-content">Low cost technologies will be applied to provide the water and environmental sanitation facilities to the population. Increased community participation in programme activities will be promoted where community members will be trained to manage their facilities. Hundreds of wells and hand pumps constructed 5 - 12 years ago are damaged and needs repairs instead of constructing new ones. Chlorination activities of both non-traditional and traditional water sources will be vigorously pursued with the training of well owners and Blue Flag Volunteers to prevent outbreak of diarrhoea diseases.</p>
          <p id="project-content">The Needy Today will work in cooperation with NGOs, networks, foundations and volunteers to increase access to safe drinking water supply in selected communities, schools and Public Health Units in the rural poor unnoticed; provide access to proper hygiene and sanitation facilities within communities in the provinces selected and where wells are repaired; promote positive hygiene practices to enhance healthy lifestyles especially in institutions and poor health underdeveloped villages; and prevent the incidence of cholera and reduces the case fatality rates of the diseases.</p>
          <br>

        <h1 id="project-regular-title">Nutrition</h1>
        <div class="text">
          <p id="project-content">The widespread nature of malnutrition in the whole country is a manifestation of prolonged deprivations in access to adequate food, health, safe water and sanitation facilities, and inability of an estimated 80% of households, particularly women, to provide appropriate care to their children within the context of a complex emergency. While the health, water and sanitation sectors continue to grapple with high incidences of diarrhoea, measles and acute respiratory infections, which contribute to malnutrition; the food situation has remained precarious. Most households directly or indirectly affected by the war, have been exposed to the risk of inability to access food for their members through sources other than food aid. The minimum wage of those who have been lucky to retain their jobs, meets only 36% of the staple food bills, and most farmers have had to consume their seed stock.</p>
          <p id="project-content">Anaemia in pregnancy is a problem for women. Many nursing mothers are experiencing lactation failure. The Needy Today will work with partners to set up a wet feeding centre for malnourished children and provide such feeds at strategic centres in communities lacking food supplies; introduce gardening, food processing and income generation activities in communities on household food security promotion efforts, reduce the prevalence of moderate and severe malnutrition in children in high-risk communities through community based nutrition education. The Needy Today’s expected outputs are the reduction of risks of mortality from diarrhoea, measles and acute respiratory infections through Vitamin A supplementation, risks of malnutrition and improve nutrition status of lactating and pregnant women and children.</p>

        <h1 id="project-regular-title">Education Program</h1>
        <div class="text">
          <p id="project-content">The war greatly affected the physical and psycho-social lives of many children and youths in Sierra Leone. The situation is characterised by declining government services, chronic poverty, broken school infrastructure, low illiteracy rates, falling enrolment rates, insufficient trained teachers, and insufficient relevant teaching and learning materials. The illiteracy rate is estimated at an alarming 80%. The present government capacity can only cater to about 45% of the school age population that is more youths especially the female youths and disables need opportunities for basic learning and life skills.</p>
          <p id="project-content">To address some of these problems The Needy Today will work with the Ministry of youths, Education and Sports (MYES), educational agencies and institutions to enroll more children and youths in basic and vocational institutions.</p>
          <p id="project-content">The Needy Today will work with NGOs to provide educational materials to institutions; enable 5,000 children commence/re-commence schooling within their communities every year till 2015; respond to the emergency needs of 5,000 the disables, adolescent girls in formal and non-formal institutions in the rural; strengthen the local communities/Village Development Committees and other groups in the communities to provide basic education for children, adolescents, youths and adult women; and donate used or new computers to institutions, establish e-learning centers and free cafes to bridge the international digital divide.</p>
